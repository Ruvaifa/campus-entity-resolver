## 6. Routing Integration

### Updated Routes in `App.tsx`:
```tsx
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<DashboardLayout />}>
  <Route index element={<Dashboard />} />
  <Route path="entities" element={<Entities />} />
  <Route path="security" element={<Security />} />  // ✅ NEW
  <Route path="alerts" element={<Alerts />} />      // ✅ NEW
  <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />  // ✅ NEW
</Route>
```

## 7. Mock Data Structure

All pages use realistic mock data that follows the PRD specifications:

### Security Mock Data:
- Threat statistics
- Timeline data (24-hour intervals)
- Severity distribution
- Active threats with entity/location/evidence
- Recent activity logs

### Alerts Mock Data:
- Alert statistics
- 7-day trend data
- Category distribution
- Active alerts with full details
- Resolved alerts with resolution info

### Settings Mock Data:
- Default threshold values (75% confidence, 65% alert)
- Toggle states (privacy, notifications, etc.)
- System information (version, status, sync time)

---

## 8. PRD Alignment

### Requirements Met:
✅ **Security Dashboard** - Real-time monitoring with threat detection
✅ **Alerts System** - Comprehensive alert management with filtering
✅ **Settings** - Privacy controls, thresholds, and theme toggle
✅ **Dark/Light Mode** - Full theme support across all features
✅ **Color Schema** - Strict adherence to PRD color specifications
✅ **UI Consistency** - Matches Dashboard design pattern
✅ **Explainability** - Evidence and provenance shown for alerts
✅ **Privacy** - PII masking and image blur toggles

### Alert Types Implemented (per PRD):
- Not Seen >12 hours
- Simultaneous ID Use
- Device Without Swipe
- Unauthorized Access
- Low Confidence Match
- Unusual Access Pattern

---

## 9. Next Steps for Backend Integration

### API Endpoints Needed:
```
GET  /api/security/stats
GET  /api/security/threats
GET  /api/security/activity
GET  /api/alerts
POST /api/alerts/:id/resolve
POST /api/alerts/:id/escalate
GET  /api/settings
POST /api/settings
```

### State Management:
- Replace mock data with API calls
- Add loading states
- Add error handling
- Implement real-time updates (WebSocket/polling)

### Additional Features:
- Alert filtering and search
- Evidence modal with provenance details
- Export functionality
- Audit log viewer
- User role-based access control
